<p>Children are very interested in animals and birds.  Children learn birds at the preschool age by listening to birds sounds and seeing them with their own eyes. This video fulfills this educational purpose perfectly by using close-up video footage of common birds and fowls.</p>
<p>Birds use their voices to communicate with other birds. Birds can sing at any time of day, but their songs are often louder, livelier, and more frequent during the dawn. In most bird species, only male birds sing, attempting to attract mates and warn other males away from their territories.Not all of the bird noises are attractive to your ears. Some of the birds sing very pleasantly, whereas some of the birds make loud and not so pretty sounds for the human ear. Bird identification is a fun and useful skill, as bird sounds are a part of our lives in the cities and in nature.
